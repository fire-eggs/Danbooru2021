The tags_by_year.py script was used to create the tags_by_year.csv file. The
csv file was then imported to LibreOffice Calc to make the charts.

The csv file has the following format:

`subject`;total-posts;posts-for-2005;posts-for-2006;...;posts-for-2020;posts-for-2021

(yes, semi-colon separated, single quotes for string delimiter).

Note the dataset has only a tiny number of posts from 2021, so the last column
is not truly significant.
